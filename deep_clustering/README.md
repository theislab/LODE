# [How to do Unsupervised Clustering with Keras](https://www.dlology.com/blog/how-to-do-unsupervised-clustering-with-keras/) | DLology Blog


## How to Run
Require [Python 3.5+](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.4/python-3.6.4.exe) and [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) installed
### Clone or download this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/Tony607/Keras_Deep_Clustering
```
### Install required libraries
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`


In the project start a command line run
```
jupyter notebook
```
In the opened browser window open
```
Keras-DEC.ipynb
```
If you want to skip the training, you can try the pre-trained weights from the releases, [results.zip](https://github.com/Tony607/Keras_Deep_Clustering/releases/download/V0.1/results.zip). Extract 
`results` folders to the root of the project directory.

Happy coding! Leave a comment if you have any question.
