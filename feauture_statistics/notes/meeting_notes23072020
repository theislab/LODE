which data do we have

we have all clinical data
visual acuity 


Prediction target:


########################
time until try:

(Injection treat Fluids only, atrophy and fibrosis increase.)

how many injections until dry (only treat wet AMD)
or time until dry

AMD patients more reliable than diabetic

what is dry?
- dry means either no fluid at all (intra and sub retinal fluid)


########################
Surface area of fibrosis as a function of number of treatments.
location (distance to fovea) how many develope fibrosis in fovea as a function of number of treatments
choroid thickness in terms of number of injections and in relation to time to dry.
Determine fovea location from OCT: 


########################
predict conversion in late stage AMD

how to define in terms of clinical features - to be discussed?
the more geographic atrophy the more late stage geographic. 

more atrophy means less sensory cells.

Multiple features determine atrophy.

absence of RPE is best defenition now do columns wise
Choroid gets thinner.
Sometimes makes thinner but sometimes thicker if Fibrosis if present.

Note: Once there is atrophy then one can not get back, i.e. always predict from not having to getting atrophy.

########################
Choroid - not correlated with atrophy


########################
Groups of patients:

Naive compared to treated patients:

naive patients: patients who never got treated vs treated scans
treated naive scan: scan of the first visiit

- if naive patient have been treated at other clinic then its not naive, so we need list from Michael.

treated patients: patients who have visited clinical before or have had treatment.

Start by doing all the statiscs and prognstics on certain naive patients.


########################
treatment plan: treat and extend depending on patient treatment.

divide lucentis vs. alea injection.
how does the diff drugs work better for diff feature states.

########################
Thickness of retina especially in center.

We can use normal & pathological thickness for prediction labels.

########################
Compare statistics based on Gender, age groups.
medication that the patients recieved.
medication switches (time periods)
patients who switched
subgroups by vision (VA, diseases, gluacome, amd, diabetic retinopathy)
patients with only amd or with other diseases as well
